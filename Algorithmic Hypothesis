Algorithmic Options

1. Brute Force
    The brute force solution to this solution is simple, yet wildly inefficient.
    Since each person is able to request any other person, potentially creating
    (similar to) a complete graph, leaves the order of growth to this problem
    of a factorial nature. Each room can potentially contain any combination of
    people leaving the possible combinations. For example, in a group with
    only 20 kids divided into 5 rooms of 4, the combinations exceed 2e16. In a
    program with 50 people splitting into 5 groups of 10, the combinations
    exceed 1.67e+57.

2. Gale Shapley / Residency Matching
    At first glance this problem seems similar to residency matching in that they
    both require matching groups based on requests. However, the algorithmic property
    essential to the functionality of Gale-Shapley is its bipartite nature. By
    exploiting this property, the algorithm efficiently iterates through potential
    matches.
    Unfortunately, the roommate pairing algorithm is not bipartite in nature. Each
    person is able to request any other.
